## Introduction

This page is a summary of the works that I completed in my
CSC-490 class at The College of Idaho. This course was a special
topics course that focused on command line use within WSL2, IDE 
use with Visual Studio Code, and the use of git version control.

## Using WSL2

In this class I learned how to properly use the Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL),
to run Ubuntu 20.04 on my machine.

## Bash Scripting

I also learned how to write scripts in bash. Some examples of scripts that I wrote
include a script that allows the root user to create new users on the system, and a script
to fix broken symlinks. 

## Command Line Use

In this class I learned not only how to navigate a linux 
system from the command line, but how to do so proficiently.
I began by learning to use bash, but eventually switched to using
zsh where I was able to modify my shell to look exactly how I want.
With zsh I learned how to load and use various plugins.
I learned to be proficient with Vim for the purpose of having
solid knowledge of a powerful text editor that I will have access
to in almost any environment.

## Version Control

I learned how to effectively use git version control system to
collaborate on projects.

## Visual Studio

Having already been a Visual Studio Code user for a while, I was already quite
familiar with the concepts related to VSC in class. I did, however, learn many
new keyboard shortcuts to increase my efficiency by decreasing how much I need
to use my mouse.
I also learned how to write my own snippets so that I can have snippets in the
exact styling that I like to code with.
